# Halloween 2025


### TODO: TESLA/HUE/NEST
[] Check Hue lights state - seems to run DISCO ok, but turns on briefly when STOPPED state invoked
[] Implement counters - a fire counter, and a Tesla open trunk counter - should be persistent between container launches, include reset button
[] Implement standard way to retrieve, modify and set config settings remotely
[x] Trunk telemetry does not show OPEN during PLAYING status (although Tesla app shows open trunk)
